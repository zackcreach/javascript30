    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let age = 100;
    // let age2 = age;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);

    // let name = 'Zack';
    // let name2 = name;
    // console.log(name, name2);
    // name = 'Zachary';
    // console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // Slice, if passed nothing, will actually make a copy of the array, as opposed to referencing it by default
    const team2 = players.slice();


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    // You take a blank array and you concatenate in the existing array. Copy/paste basically.
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'newness';
    console.log(team4);

    // Or use array.from!
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Zack Creach',
      age: 30
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // start with a blank object for first arg, then pass in the object to copy
    // in arg 3, fold in new properties you wish you overwrite
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99});
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const zack = {
      name: 'Zack',
      age: 30,
      social: {
        twitter: '@zackcreach',
        instagram: 'zackcreach'
      }
    }
    console.clear();
    console.log(zack);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, zack);

    // hacky method, not recommended, as it converts to string with stringify and then immediately parse it back to an object
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(zack));
